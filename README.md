These are simulation data for the paper "Controls of the Foreland Deformation Pattern in the Orogen-Foreland Shortening System: Constraints from High-Resolution Geodynamic Models"

The geodynamic code is an open-source code - LaMEM (Lithosphere and Mantle Evolution Model), which can be downloaded from:

https://bitbucket.org/bkaus/lamem

Here M1.dat - M20.dat are the input files used to produce the model results in this paper.
